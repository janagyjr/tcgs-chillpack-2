# TCG's Chill Pack - Part Deux

Well I have made another Chill Pack and this one is even better than my awesome 1.7.10 pack (which you can find [here](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/tcgs-chill-pack)). This is a completely reimagined Chill Pack for a completely reimagined Minecraft. Based in 1.20.1 we're hoping to continue to find the best and the chillest of modpacks! Illagers need not apply.

With easy resource production, fun porting around mods, and some new dimensions, Chill Pack Part Deux is sure to give you the challenges you crave while still allowing you to just sit back, relax, and engage in epic building projects!
