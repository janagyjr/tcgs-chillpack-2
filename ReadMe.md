Well, I have made another Chill Pack, and this one is even better than my awesome 1.7.10 pack (which you can still find [here](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/tcgs-chill-pack)). This is a completely reimagined Chill Pack for a completely reimagined Minecraft. Based on 1.20.1, we're hoping to continue to build the best and the chillest of modpacks! Illagers need not apply.

With easy resource production (Growable Ores, Tinker's Construct, Resource Chickens), fun moving around mods (Iron Jetpacks, Waystones), and some new dimensions (Lost Cities, RFTools Dimensions), Chill Pack Part Deux is sure to give you the challenges you crave (Philip's Ruins, Supplementaries, Apotheosis) while still allowing you to just sit back, relax, and engage in epic building projects!

You can find me and other pack contributors in my Guilded community [TCG's Chill Army HQ](https://www.guilded.gg/i/kK5nobVE)!
